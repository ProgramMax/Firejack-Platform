             * then it will quickly exceed the width of the hidden file input's "Browse..."
             * button, so part of the custom button's clickable area will be covered by
             * the hidden file input's text box instead. This results in a text-selection
             * mouse cursor over that part of the button, at least in Firefox, which is
             * confusing to a user. Giving the hidden file input a huge font-size makes
             * the native button part very large so it will cover the whole clickable area.
